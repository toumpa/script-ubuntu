he is a student to whom I'm teaching English this year
he is a dreamer
he is the prime minister of this country
he is the man we were talking about
he is there for a few days
he was a student at that time
he was to have dined with us, but he became seriously sick all of a sudden
he was the first to enter the room
he was there on business
I think she is a good dancer
she is the one who feeds our dog
she was an actor
I assumed that she was there
she was the First Lady
I think it is a warning
I know how hard it is to do that
it is the same book as the one I have
it is there to the left
no one told me that it was a costume party
it was the best part of the whole trip
they were to meet here at seven
they were the first to get into the bus
he is preparing for the test
he is studying at his desk
she is knitting a scarf
she is already sleeping
this is a triangle
Tom was an architect
it is the story of a boy, a girl, and a cat
the challenges are enormous
the old house was in bad shape
he is not only brave but wise
he put the book on the shelf
she took down a book from the shelf
they say he is a good doctor
they are talking over a cup of coffee in the cafeteria
I believe it is finished
I think she is over forty years old
there are computers here
I didn't listen to the news yesterday
we have to act now
why were only students invited?
to be employed, you must fill out an application
I like the color of this car
we search the whole neighborhood for our lost puppy
they say he is the best tennis player
they told us to wait
they claim that next summer will be the hottest of the century
I didn't pay attention to what they were saying
what were they laughing at?
